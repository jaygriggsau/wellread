# :book: Well Read
This app is an online book club, add books to your reading list, reccomend books and see what books are popular.

## GOALS
My goal was to use not copy and paste code, write smaller code sections, test for errors often. For creating routes I just followed the dittys.

I wanted to to use MVC fromn the start as well.

## How It Went
Slower not copying and pasting code, but it made a lot more sense and helped me trace errors. Testing more often after nearly change made following error logs and fixing errors a lot easier.

I ran into issues where there was no error message but somtehing wasn't working right and had to trace that issue down still which took time/help.

## :sad: Lessons learnt

Planned what I thought was going to be simple but one part, the main feature, turned out complex, bogging me down for hours. Severly.

Over estimated how long it would take to write the correct SQL using three tables.
Not asking the right type of help.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Using API to show catalouge of books that users can search and add to their list.
- Using API to generate book covers instead of user uploading them
- Autocomlete on search 
- Show most reccomended books.
- Remove items from your reading list
